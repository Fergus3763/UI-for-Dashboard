        This page will become the global Add-On catalogue for the hotel, bringing
        together everything configured under Rooms → Add-Ons.
      </p>

        It will list all add-ons, show where they are used, and surface key details such
        as pricing model, tax class, and visibility flags.

        For this phase it is just a static placeholder so that the navigation is complete
        and future work has a clear home.
