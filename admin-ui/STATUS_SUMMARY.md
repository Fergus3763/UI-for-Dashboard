# STATUS SUMMARY (Admin UI)

> ⚠️ This file is no longer the authoritative HUB status document.

From HUB#4 onwards, **all project-level HUB status and integration notes live in:**

- `handover/STATUS_SUMMARY.md`  ← single source of truth (“HUB Status Summary — Living Document”).

This file is kept only as a convenience pointer for people who land in `admin-ui/`.
For Admin UI persistence details, also see:
