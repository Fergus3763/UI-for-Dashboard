📌 SPOKE PROMPT — RFQ Add-On Exposure (Phase 1)
Role

You are acting as a UI + light logic Spoke implementing RFQ add-on exposure for large meetings.

This is not a booking system change.
This is not a pricing logic rewrite.
This is not a backend or Netlify function change.

You will only touch admin / hotel dashboard + admin Booker Preview code.

🎯 Objective (Plain English)

Enable larger meetings (above a hotel-defined capacity threshold) to:

expose the full optional add-on catalogue to the booker,

allow the booker to select and price those add-ons,

produce a priced RFQ / pre-contract view,

without allowing instant booking.

Small meetings must remain exactly as they are today.

🔑 Core Rule (Do Not Violate)

Small meetings stay curated. Large meetings get full choice.

There must be no behaviour change for meetings below the threshold.

🧠 Definitions (Use These Terms Exactly)

ONLINE BOOKABLE

Layout max capacity ≤ threshold

Existing behaviour only

Curated optional add-ons only

RFQ / PRE-CONTRACT

Layout max capacity > threshold

Full optional add-on catalogue visible

Pricing calculated, booking disabled

🏗️ Scope of Work (What You MAY Touch)
In scope

Admin / Hotel dashboard pages only:

Booker Preview (admin preview only)

Simulation / Modelling (if needed for parity)

Room Layout logic (read-only consumption)

Add-Ons catalogue (read-only consumption)

Light logic only:

conditional rendering

filtering

gating UI sections

Explicitly OUT of scope ❌

No changes to:

pricing formulas

save_config / load_config

booking, availability, or calendar logic

Netlify functions

database schema

No duplication of pricing logic

No new APIs

No new dependencies

🧩 Implementation Rules
1. Capacity Threshold

Assume a single numeric threshold (e.g. 20).

For Phase 1:

You may hardcode this value OR

Read it from an existing config if already present

Do not design a new admin UI for it yet.

2. How to Detect RFQ Mode

Use layout max capacity:

IF selectedLayout.maxCapacity > threshold
→ RFQ MODE
ELSE
→ ONLINE MODE


This logic must be:

isolated

readable

easy to remove or extend later

3. Add-On Exposure Rules
ONLINE MODE

Show:

included add-ons

room-level optional add-ons only

Behaviour must remain unchanged

RFQ MODE

Show:

included add-ons

ALL optional add-ons from the global catalogue

Ignore room-level optional filtering

Allow selection + pricing

Label clearly as:

“Pre-contract configuration (subject to confirmation)”

4. Booker Preview Behaviour

In RFQ mode:

Show full pricing breakdown

Show total price

Replace any “Book” CTA with:

“Request confirmation”

or equivalent non-committal language

No submission logic required.
No saving required.

🧪 Acceptance Criteria

This work is complete when:

Small meetings behave exactly as before

Large meetings expose full optional add-on catalogue

Pricing totals update correctly

No instant booking is possible for RFQ mode

No backend changes are required

No existing tests / flows are broken

📂 Files & Permissions

You must not guess file paths.

You are explicitly allowed to:

request any file you need (read-only),

request confirmation before touching shared components.

If unsure → ask.

📦 Deliverables

For each batch of work:

Full delete-and-replace for modified files

One clear commit message

3–5 bullet summary of what changed

🧭 Design Philosophy Reminder

This feature exists to:

eliminate pricing labour,

qualify serious buyers,

preserve human closing.

Do not over-engineer.
Do not future-proof.
Do not optimise prematurely.

Acknowledge when ready and request the first file you need.
