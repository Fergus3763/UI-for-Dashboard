START
1) I'm working with a company in the hospitality sector. 
2) They have developed a SaaS offering for Hotels to market and manage their Spas and treatments. 
3) It is a fully automated service for the User (The hotels Spa Customer).Fully Automated in that from the point of clicking on the "Book A Treatment" button right through Offers, Information, Filtering, T&Cs, Payment to the point of arriving for the treatment there's is no human engagement in the process from the Hotel/Venue side. I am working with them to create a similar SaaS offering that would enable Hotels(and other venues) with Meeting rooms to a) Speed up sales and b) cut down cost
4) We believe there is a substantial part of that Meeting Room Hire market which is not being catered for = The Post-Covid on-demand Small-Team meeting. Traditionally meeting rooms were booked wholly in direct, human-to-human engagement or an Online Enquiry followed by a human-to-human engagement and confirmation. This works ok for large events with a long lead time. Covid changed the Market, seeing a drop off in large gatherings and an increase in small 2-20 person meetups. In contrast this market wants low friction engagement, instant pricing and instant booking. These use cases are expensive for hotels with high labour costs for lower return. 
5) We aim to resolve that by automating the entire process for both parties. That requires that at the end of the process BOTH parties have sufficient CONFIDENCE in the integrity of the product and the price that they contract = [BUY] responded to by [ORDER CONFIRMED]. From a sales point of view we have one issue = Our customers will not buy and deploy 2 Meeting Room Property Management Systems (ours and existing Large event focused one) therefore we must build ours to accommodate/facilitate all their room sizes and configurations. Bookers of large events will always want Human to Human engagement but both sides will value the price accuracy. The set-up for the Hotel Admin person is more detailed than they are used to but once done can be replicated easily(our ambition). Additionally for the venue the very granular level of detail they can bring to their pricing will be enlightening and price points easily tweaked to ensure consistent margins across all the inputs dictating room price.
 
6) Meeting Room Booking is currently slow and labour intensive for both the booker and the hotel. 
7) This is due to the large amount of variables involved, from the number of attendees, the number of hours/days, Preferred Layout(Board room, U-Shape, Classroom etc. etc. Inclusive and exclusive services, ALL possible Add-Ons(including custom/hotel-unique) in multiple cost centres =Inclusive F&B, AV, Labour, 3rd Party hire-ins, Other, VAT. 
8) Each Meeting room (there could be multiple) must have a calendar where, a) already booked &Paid reservation is closed out, Days which are typically not available for meetings, can be closed out by the Hotel Administrator. Venues must have ability to Close out periods at their discretion. 
9) Venues/Hotels committing to a fully automated booking system must be confident that the price Generated (and paid for by the Room Booker) is accurate. To this end they will have to front load all price creators. This requires a detailed input UI Interface feeding a database with ALL the possible query answers necessary to automate the user/room booker's [Search, Customise, Pay and Arrive experience]. 
10) Working with me:  I am not technical but I know the Hotel/Workspace business and the market, I know the Solution I am looking for visually and it’s usability. I have a basic understanding of GITHUB and Netlify and no desire (if possible) to learn  to navigate new applications -If I have to, I have to. 
11)  Working with me:  At ALL TIMES (and I cannot emphasise this point enough) I must be able to see all agreed work in a single page/file. If something is not in the page/file = IT DOES NOT EXIST. 
12)  Working with me:  Please keep my steps short = 2-4 short parts per post. Request DONE message from me for each Post.  If it is in Github or Netlify I do not require you to do a preamble/Explainer of what we are doing other than in the broadest(shortest) terms. If I have an issue I will ask. 
13) Spokes: Your Processing Capacity/Tokens must be protected at all times. Creating New/Next Hub is onerous and potentially detrimental to the Project. Where at all possible you should propose a Spoke to do development/heavy lifting with Prompts and fine tuning being your Spoke related tasks. I expect YOU to propose Spokes as required. Your choice between spinning out a project(Spoke) and doing the work itself will be informed by A) The time involved in Creating a prompt Vs the time it would take you to develop the code. B) The time and Tokens Spoke will expend WALKING ME(Entirely non-technical) through the process and fixing bugs V’s You the Hub will expend in FINITE RESOURCES  WALKING ME through it. I will absolutely slow either of you down but a spoke is focused on nothing BUT his short term task. You will have multiple Spokes and management tasks going on.
