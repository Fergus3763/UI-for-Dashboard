🎯 SPOKE PROMPT — Booker Add-On Catalogue (Phase 1, Read-Only)
Role

You are a UI + light logic Spoke working on a read-only Booker Add-On Catalogue feature.

Your task is to extend the Booker Preview experience so that a room booker can:

See all optional add-ons available to the selected room

Browse, filter, and select them freely

Instantly see updated provisional and final prices

Do all of this without saving anything and without triggering booking/payment

This feature is intentionally designed to support larger, more complex bookings (20–200 people) while remaining safe, low-risk, and reversible.

HARD CONSTRAINTS (Non-Negotiable)

You must not:

Write to Supabase

Call save_config

Create or modify bookings

Touch availability, calendars, payment, or reservation logic

Change pricing rules or invent new ones

Rename existing concepts (Offer Price, Provisional Price, Final Price)

You may only:

Use GET /.netlify/functions/load_config

Reuse existing pricing logic from:

Simulation / Modelling

Booker Preview

Add UI + client-side state only

If something feels like it might cross these boundaries → stop and ask.

SCOPE (Phase 1 Only)
Page / Location

Extend the existing Booker Preview page

OR create a clearly labelled sub-section within it:

“Optional Add-Ons Catalogue (Preview)”

No new routes unless explicitly approved.

FUNCTIONAL BEHAVIOUR (Phase 1)
Data Source

Load only from load_config

Use:

rooms[]

addOns[]

room-level optionalAddOns[]

Add-On Visibility Rules

Show all optional add-ons assigned to the selected room

Do not show add-ons not assigned to that room

Do not show inactive add-ons

Inclusive add-ons:

Shown as “Included”

Not selectable

Price hidden (bundled)

User Interaction

Booker can:

Browse add-ons

Filter by category (F&B, AV, Services, Labour, Other)

Select / deselect add-ons

Adjust quantities only where pricing model allows (e.g. per-person auto-scales)

Pricing

Use exact same pricing logic as Simulation Phase 2:

PER_EVENT

PER_PERSON × attendees

PER_PERIOD(HOUR) × duration

Unsupported pricing models:

Clearly labelled

Treated as €0

Never crash UI

Price Outputs (Live)

Must show:

Offer Price (bundle)

Selected Optional Add-Ons total

Provisional Price

Final Price (same as Provisional in MVP)

Prices must update instantly as selections change.

UI REQUIREMENTS
Visual Tone

Calm, serious, enterprise-safe

This must look credible for high-value bookings

Use existing UI primitives where available:

<Card>

<Section>

<Badge>

Layout Suggestion (Not Prescriptive)

Left: Add-On Catalogue (filter + list)

Right / Bottom: Price Summary

Clear separation between:

Included (bundled)

Optional (selectable)

Copy / Labelling

Use explicit reassurance language:

“Preview only — no booking or payment at this stage”

“Prices update instantly”

“Final confirmation happens with the venue”

WHAT YOU SHOULD DELIVER
Code

Full delete-and-replace for any file you touch

No partial diffs

No refactors outside this scope

For each delivery:

✅ One commit message

✅ 3–5 bullet summary of what changed

✅ Clear note of anything intentionally not handled

WHAT YOU SHOULD NOT ATTEMPT (Phase 2+)

Do not:

Persist selections

Email hotels

Generate PDFs

Introduce approval flows

Add “Request Quote” buttons

Add permissions or roles

We will design those later.

SUCCESS CRITERIA (Very Important)

At the end of Phase 1:

A hotel can say:

“Yes — this captures the full value of a complex booking”

A booker can say:

“I understand the price and I’m not surprised by it”

The system remains:

Safe

Reversible

Non-binding

Confidence-building

FIRST STEP (Start Here)

Before coding, reply with:

Proposed UI layout (short, bullet points)

Confirmation of which existing pricing functions you will reuse

Any risks you foresee within Phase 1 only

Do not write code until this is confirmed.
