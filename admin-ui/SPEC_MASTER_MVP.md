# SPEC_MASTER_MVP (Admin UI pointer)

> ⚠️ This is **not** the canonical spec for the project.

From HUB#4 onwards, the **single authoritative MVP spec** lives in:

- `handover/SPEC_MASTER_MVP.md`

That file defines:
- The overall product scope and ambition.
- Admin UI and Booker MVP requirements.
- Integration expectations between Admin, API, database, and Booker.

This file is kept only so that anyone landing in `admin-ui/` knows **where to look**.
Do **not** maintain a separate spec here — update `handover/SPEC_MASTER_MVP.md` instead.
