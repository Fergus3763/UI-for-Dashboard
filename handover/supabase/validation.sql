This section records the official results of the database validation for the MVP seed. Paste-only instructions below ensure repeatability and clarity.
## Row Counts (paste result table below)

-- Run in Supabase SQL editor:
select 'vat' as table_name, count(*) as row_count from vat
union all select 'catalog', count(*) from catalog
union all select 'rooms', count(*) from rooms
union all select 'durations', count(*) from durations
union all select 'room_catalog_map', count(*) from room_catalog_map
order by table_name;

## Detail Queries (run only if any count above > 0)

### Duplicate room codes
select code, count(*) as dup_count
from rooms
group by code
having count(*) > 1
order by dup_count desc;

### Missing room references in room_catalog_map
select m.*
from room_catalog_map m
left join rooms r on r.id = m.room_id
where r.id is null
limit 100;

### Missing catalog references in room_catalog_map
select m.*
from room_catalog_map m
left join catalog c on c.id = m.catalog_item_id
where c.id is null
limit 100;

### VAT mismatches in catalog
select c.id, c.name, c.vat_category
from catalog c
left join vat v on v.name = c.vat_category
where v.name is null
limit 100;

### Rooms with zero mappings
select r.id, r.code, r.name
from rooms r
left join room_catalog_map m on m.room_id = r.id
group by r.id, r.code, r.name
having count(m.id) = 0
order by r.code;
