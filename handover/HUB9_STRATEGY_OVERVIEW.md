# HUB#9 – Strategy Overview
## Replacing Human Pricing Effort Without Removing Human Closing

### Purpose of This Document
This document explains the **product strategy shift** achieved during HUB#8 and what HUB#9 is expected to build toward.

The goal is to:
- Remove most human effort from *pricing* meeting rooms
- Preserve (and improve) human involvement in *closing* larger deals
- Use the product itself to qualify serious buyers before human contact

This is a **business-first** document. Technical implementation details live elsewhere.

## Core Insight (What Changed)

While the product was originally framed around **small, fast, on-demand meetings (2–20 people)**, the work completed in HUB#8 has demonstrated that:

> The same pricing engine can eliminate most human pricing effort for **large meetings (20–200+)**, without forcing hotels to fully automate booking.

The difference is **where automation stops**, not how pricing works.

## Two Booking Modes (Single System)

### 1. Online Bookable Meetings (Small / Fast)
**Typical size:** Up to a hotel-defined capacity threshold (e.g. 20)

**Characteristics**
- Instant pricing
- Instant booking
- Minimal configuration
- Low cognitive load

**Add-On Behaviour**
- Booker sees:
  - Included add-ons
  - A *hotel-curated subset* of optional add-ons
- Booker does NOT see the full add-on catalogue

**Why**
- Speed > completeness
- Too many options increase friction
- Hotel already knows what small meetings usually need

This behaviour already exists and remains unchanged.

### 2. RFQ / Pre-Contract Meetings (Large / Complex)
**Typical size:** Above the hotel-defined capacity threshold

**Characteristics**
- Complex requirements
- Higher value bookings
- Multiple cost centres
- Historically labour-heavy to price

**Add-On Behaviour**
- Booker gains access to:
  - Included add-ons
  - **The full optional add-on catalogue**
- Booker can:
  - Select, quantify, and price all optional services
  - See a transparent, structured price

**Outcome**
- Booker submits a *priced, fully specified request*
- Hotel receives:
  - A qualified lead
  - Complete event requirements
  - A buyer already aligned with the price

Human interaction happens **after pricing**, not before.

---

## Why This Is a Win-Win

### For Hotels
- Massive reduction in:
  - Back-and-forth emails
  - Manual repricing
  - “What if” calls
- Staff time is spent **closing**, not calculating
- Pricing consistency across all booking sizes

### For Bookers
- Price transparency
- Control and confidence
- No need to “guess” requirements over multiple calls

---

## Key Principle for HUB#9

> **Automation replaces pricing labour, not sales relationships.**

The product’s job is to:
- Gather requirements
- Calculate price accurately
- Surface buyer intent

The human’s job is to:
- Finalise terms
- Build trust
- Close the deal

## MVP Messaging for Demos

“This room can be booked instantly online up to X people.

For larger events, you can fully configure and price your meeting online before speaking to our team — so when we talk, we’re already aligned.”

This is the positioning HUB#9 should preserve and build toward.
